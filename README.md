## About this Repository

This development adds Compaction-Aware Zone Allocation Algorithm to [ZenFS](https://github.com/westerndigitalcorporation/zenfs).

## Compaction-Aware Zone Allocation(CAZA) Overview

CAZA was designed based on how the compaction process selects, merges and invalidates SSTables in the LSM tree. 
As such, CAZAâ€™s design considering the compaction process of LSM-tree maximizes the zone cleaning efficiency of ZenFS by consolidating SSTables with overlapping key ranges located at different levels in the LSM-tree in the same zone and invalidating them together during zone cleaning.

Please refer [Compaction-aware zone allocation for LSM based key-value store on ZNS SSDs](https://discos.sogang.ac.kr/file/2022/intl_conf/HotStorage_2022_H_lee.pdf).

## Dependencies
[libzbd](https://github.com/westerndigitalcorporation/libzbd) and Linux Kernel 5.4 or later

## How to Run

### Build
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/lass-lab/CAZA.git
   ```
   ```
   cd CAZA
   ```
   ```
   make db_bench zenfs
   ```
### Setup ZBD emulation using nullb 
   More about zbd emulation : [zonedstorage.io](https://zonedstorage.io/docs/getting-started/zbd-emulation)
   
   Ensure your system has more physical memory than the intended emulation capacity.
   ```
   # ./setup_zone_nullblk.sh
   ```
   
   Modify the script to alter the Zone configuration.
   
   Following example emulate 50GB ZBD.
   - 50 zones with a size of 1GB.
   - The size of each block is 4096 bytes.
   ```
   ZONE_SZ=1024 #Mega Byte
   BLOCK_SZ=4096 #Byte
   NR_ZONE=50

   SIZE=$(($ZONE_SZ*$NR_ZONE))

   modprobe null_blk
   cd /sys/kernel/config/nullb &&
       mkdir -p zns_nullb &&
       cd zns_nullb ; echo 0 > power;
       echo 1 > zoned &&
       echo $ZONE_SZ > zone_size &&
       echo 0 > zone_nr_conv &&
       echo 0 > completion_nsec &&
       echo $BLOCK_SZ > blocksize &&
       echo $SIZE > size &&
       echo 1 > memory_backed &&
       echo 1 > power;
   ```
